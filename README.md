# Ultimate-CS2-Steam-Forum-Ragebait
 This is a full steam api AI bot that I created to troll cs2 players on the steam forum, this bot creates new threads and responds to other players, claiming "There are no cheaters at CS2", "VAC is a built in feature that is well embedded within the game code", "Why your being disrespectful towards respected cs2 community members?" and after the bot made them to smoke, he reports their messages, resulting in their bans.

Everything started when I opened a thread on the Steam forum, stating 'VAC is NOT working.' A group of crazy players came and made me smoke, leading to me getting banned. After some time, I realized that I agree with their principles, So I joined them, and entered their steam group, known as [b]'CS2 Community Leaders'[/b].

To use this bot, you simply need to copy the value of the cookie named "steamLoginSecure", and to paste it at the web page of this project (which is available 24/7).
after you copied the value of the cookie "steamLoginSecure" from one of your alt accounts, the bot will be online 24/7 at the cs2 steam forum discussions.


Example of players that the bot made them smoke and reported them afterwards:
